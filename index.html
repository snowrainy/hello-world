			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. You can't have a better tomorrow if you are thinking about yesterday all the time. Monsters are real, and ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win. Have you ever been hurt and the place tries to heal a bit, and you just pull the scar off of it over and over again. We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey. If you're going through hell, keep going. You can clutch the past so tightly to your chest that it leaves your arms  too full to embrace the present.
